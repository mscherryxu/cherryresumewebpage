        <h1>Cherry Xu</h1>
        <h2>Clinical Dietitian</h2>

        <p>I've been working as a full-time Registered Dietitian for the past 6 years in both community and clinical settings, and working with people and helping others achieve their goals bring me a lot of joy.</p>
        <p>I wanted a career change for the past couple of years, and I finally decided to take a course on Python through Coursera last summer and made a simple calculator for 2 numbers.</p>
        <p>Recently, I started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and realized I enjoy creating visually appealing webpages that can help people find information they may need, and now I am pursuing a career as a frontend developer! While learning, I would love to help others who are learning like I am too.</p>
