          <h2>Clinical Dietitian</h2>

          <p>I have been a Registered Dietitian for the last 6 years in both community
            and clinical settings, and I have been contemplating on a career change for
            the past couple of years. I dabbled in some Python last summer and
            decided to also learn some HTML/CSS. I am in the process of becoming
            a frontend developer and would like to keep learning! </p>
          <p>I enjoy working with people and helping others achieve their goals.
           While learning, I will also try to help others along the way if I can.</p>
